## `cp_badlands` and `koth_badlands` crashing on load
Grab the [old 2010 version of `cp_badlands`](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5b10le16ewjx3ob/cp_badlands_2010.bsp?dl=0) (found from [this r/SFM post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SFM/comments/3y2k54/a_fix_to_the_cp_badlands_crash/))
As for KOTH, I couldn't find a fixed version.
